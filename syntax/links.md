# Links

Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text’s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)
```

Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

```markdown
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```

You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:

```markdown
This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.
```

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

```markdown
[id]: http://example.com/ "Optional Title Here"
```

**GitHub** and **GitBook** supports URL autolinking. They will autolink standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text), you can simply enter the URL and it will be turned into a link to that URL.
