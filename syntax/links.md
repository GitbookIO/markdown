# Links

Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link textâ€™s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

```markdown
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)
```

Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

```markdown
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```

You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:

```markdown
This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.
```

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

```markdown
[id]: http://example.com/ "Optional Title Here"
```

**GitHub** and **GitBook** supports URL autolinking. They will autolink standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text), you can simply enter the URL and it will be turned into a link to that URL.
