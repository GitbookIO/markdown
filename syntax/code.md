# Code Blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally.

Here is an example:

    # This is an unchanged code block

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

For example:


This is a normal paragraph:

        This is a code block.
   

You can also create a code block by:

    ```

### Inline code blocks

Inline code blocks can be written using: `` `(a backtick)``.  
Example:  
***   
``This is an `inline code block`.``  
Result:  
***    
This is an `inline code block`

### Syntax highlighting

You can define the language to be used for syntax highlighting by adding the language identifier on the end of the opening tag.  
Example:   
***  
    ```js  
    var a = {};  

    ```   
Result:  
***  
```js  
  var a = {};   
```
