# Code Blocks

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally.

Here is an example:

```
This is a code block
```

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

For example:

```
This is a normal paragraph:

For example:

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
