Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally.

Here is an example:

```markdown
This is a code block
```

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

    var a = {};
    ```
