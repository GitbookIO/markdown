# <ins> Code Blocks </ins>

Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. <br> Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally.

### **Here is an example:**

```markdown
This is a code block
```

To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

### **For example:**

```markdown
This is a normal paragraph:

    This is a code block.
```

You can also create code block separated by:

    ```

## Inline code blocks

Inline code blocks can be written using: ` (back ticks)

### **For example:**

    This is a `inline code block`

### **Syntax highlighting:**

You can define the language to be used for syntax highlighting by adding the name on the opening tag. Example:

    ```javascript
    var a = {};
    ```
