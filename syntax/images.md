# Images

```markdown
# Inline

![Alternative text](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")

# Reference

![Alternative text][id]
[id]: url/to/image "Optional title"
```

As you may have noticed, images in Markdown are very similar to links. The difference is that:

- the square brackets must be prefixed with an exclamation mark and
- inside they may have some alternative text. A description of the image, which is displayed if the image can't be loaded.
